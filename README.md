# Investigating-a-Netflix-Dataset
In this project, I analyzed my personal netflix data and then communicated my findings about it.  I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make the analysis easier.
> It is recommended installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual/), which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook. You can find installation instructions [here](https://auth.udacity.com/sign-in?next=https%3A%2F%2Fclassroom.udacity.com%2Fauthenticated).

## What did I need to install? I installed Python, plus the following libraries:

* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

## Why this Project?
> In this project, I went through the data analysis process and saw how everything fit together. I also used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which made writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!
